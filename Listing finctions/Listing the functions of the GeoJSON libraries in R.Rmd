  defaultLibraries = list("stats","graphics" ,"grDevices","utils","datasets" ,"methods","base")
  # Listing the loaded libraries
  loadedLibraries = (.packages())
  # Getting the loaded libraries only
  LoadedlibrariesOnly = setdiff(loadedLibraries, defaultLibraries)
  
  # Adding package: to the names of the libraries
  libraries1= paste0("package:", LoadedlibrariesOnly)
  sapply(libraries1, ls)
